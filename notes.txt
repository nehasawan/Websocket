Why we using websocket for chat application why dont http?
-http make connection but not push data. for that you have to use polling and long polling.
- we will keep polling.

why not socket.io?
-its harder to support multiple platforms

node.js support to talk with use of axios and fetch library.

steps: 
1. install typescript
2. connect
3. event handler
4. download postman
5. how it works

browser and node.js supports websocket natively

start coding:
Q. create web socket server where client and server will talk to each other
1. isntall packages:
npm init y
npx tsc init --y
npm install typescript
npx tsc --init
 - it will create typescript.json 
 -change rootdir: ./src
 -change outdir: ./dist
 (dont forget to uncomment.)

2.create folders src and create file inside it i.e index.ts
3. change in package.json
 "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsc -b && node ./dist/index.js"
  },

now your all ts file will save in src foolder and js file will save in dist folder.
4.insta ws library npm install ws @types/ws

enter all code.
open postman (client)

server to client
postman -> websocket -> url:ws://localhost:8080 -> send

client to server
postman -> connect url -> type message-> send it. -> it will print on vs code.
